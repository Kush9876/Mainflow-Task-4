Overview

This repository contains the code for Task 4 of my internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies. In this task, I developed a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

Basic Operations: It can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear and Delete: Includes buttons to clear all inputs and delete the last entered number.
Styled User Interface: The calculator has a clean and modern user interface with a gradient background.

Files

index.html: Contains the structure of the calculator.
styles.css: Provides the styling for the calculator, making it visually appealing.
script.js: Implements the functionality of the calculator, including operations and display updates.

To use the calculator, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You can perform calculations by clicking on the buttons, and the results will be displayed in real-time.
